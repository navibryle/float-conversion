# float-conversion
I can only share the source files to prospective employers please send an email to ipenales@ualberta.ca to make a request.
Float-conversion will do various operations on a 16 bit IEEE formated float with 7 bits on the exponent and 8 bits on the mantissa and 1 bit for the sign.

+ ## myfloat.c
    myfloat.c contains functions that can extract or set each of the float's sign bit, matissa, and exponent bits.
+ ## myfloat_conv.c
  myfloat_conv.c contains functions that can convert the 16 bit float to a 32 bit or 64 bit float also in IEEE format. The conversion also works backwards.
  And finally there is also a function to convert the float to a string. 
+ ## myfloat_ops.c
  myfloat_conv.c contains functions that perform addition,substraction,multiplication, and division on the float.
  No floating point routines were used to aid the implementation of any functions here.
